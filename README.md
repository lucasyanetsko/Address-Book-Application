# Address-Book-Application
This address book application allows users to store names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers in a text file.

This program includes functionality that allows the user to view the address book as an HTML table.

Additional code provides functionality that sorts the address book by name and also deletes duplicate entries.

There's also the ability to delete an entry in the table as well as a link on each page that takes the user back to the main paige.
